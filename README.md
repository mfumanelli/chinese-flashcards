# chinese_flashcards

A goal I have had for some time is to improve my Chinese, this repo was born with the desire to have a tool to review  
the characters for HSK 1 certification. In the future I will also add the characters for later levels. One of the study  
methods I have always found most effective is the use of flashcards. Small cards on which you write a word/concept on  
one side and its explanation on the other. For years I have been using real paper flashcards for any topic, but now I  
have decided it is time to make them in digital form, so that they can also be shared with other people who might want  
to study the same topics.

# Usage

Please just run  
```
   python app.py  
```  
to open the flashcard set in your browser. The cards are proposed each time in a random order.  
Clicking on **_I knew this word! (＾▽＾)_** that word will no longer be shown afterwards. On the contrary, clicking on  
**_I didn't know this word! (T︿T)_** the card will be reinserted into the  deck at a random position.
